    \begin{rSubsection}{Purdue University}{Aug. 2015 -- Dec. 2016 \textit{and}
        Jan. 2018 -- Present}{Graduate Research Assistant}{West Lafayette, IN}
      \item Architected, implemented, and deployed open-source IoTs called
        \href{https://www.isoblue.org/}{ISOBlue} (10+ units) for ISOBUS (CAN)
        and GPS data collection from agricultural machinery. Maintained device
        to Cloud data pipeline using Kafka and project website using
        Docusaurus.
      \item Applied Interacting Multiple Models (IMM) algorithm to collected
        GPS tracks of a combine harvester for automatically tracking machine
        locations and inferring harvesting states.
      \item Conducted research on farm logistics insights mining from collected
        CAN logs using DBSCAN clustering. Also performed extensive lexical and
        semantical anlaysis for reverse-engineering CAN logs.
