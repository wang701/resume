  \begin{rSection}{Experience}
    \begin{rSubsection}{Climate LLC}{Nov. 2022 --
      Present}{Senior Data Scientist}{St Louis, MO}
      \item Lead the development and the release of a production Python package
      that processed ag machine data with an image processing technique into a
      geospatial layer that was validated to be more accurate and efficient to
      use than the existing production layer.
      \item Collaborated with members from cross-functional teams. Designed,
      implemented, and demonstrated a new customer-facing feature in a PDF
      report form in a 2-month time span. 
      \item Identified potential speakers across the org as a tech talk
      committee member to coordinate with presentation schedules and facilitate
      talks.

    \begin{rSubsection}{John Deere Intelligent Solutions Group}{Jul. 2021 --
      Oct. 2022}{Senior Navigation Engineer}{Torrance, CA}
      \item Refactored legacy codebases and improved navigational algorithms for
      weak GNSS signal environments. 
    \end{rSubsection}

    \begin{rSubsection}{Purdue University}{Aug. 2015 -- Jun. 2021}{Graduate
        Research / Teaching Assistant}{West Lafayette, IN}
      \item Performed extensive research in processing GNSS tracks from ag
      machinery with Kalman filtering and spatiotemporal clustering algorithms
      for harvest productivity analyses across multiple years and machines.
      \item Well-versed in reverse-engineering ISOBUS/CAN data for
      contextual information extractions and analytics.
      \item Architected and developed an open-source telematics unit for
      automatic CAN/GNSS/video data collection based on Yocto Linux. Deployed
      10+ such units domestically and internationally through coordinations with
      growers and machine operators.
      \item Presented various posters and presentations in various academic
      symposiums and ASABE conferences.
